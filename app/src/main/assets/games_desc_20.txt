Poker fans and enthusiasts will appreciate what SmartSoft Gaming did with its Russian Poker game. The game is placed with one fifty-two-card deck which does not include joker cards. The main goal of the game is to make the best possible hand combination out of five cards. What makes this game different from other similar poker games is that players can play on up to three positions.

Graphics and Design

Russian Poker looks like the majority of other poker games at least in its essence. The main screen where all of the actions happen is dominated by a massive poker table. On the bottom part of the screen, players can see their five cards as well as access different betting options. The bottom section of the screen also shows coin denominations players get to use. On the upper side of the screen, players will notice their opponentâ€™s hand and cards facing down before they are shown.

Gameplay

As with poker games, the winner of Russian poker sessions is the player whose five-card hand is higher in value. It should be noted that players of Russian Poker can be paid the associated amount of two combinations on a single box. Moreover, during their gameplay, players cannot see the card located on position three nor change or add anything. Therefore, the bets associated with the third position are placed automatically as players make their ante bets. Once ante bets are made, players, as well as the dealer, receive their five opening cards. At this point, players can pass and lose their bets, place another double ante bet, change their cards or buy the sixth card.
