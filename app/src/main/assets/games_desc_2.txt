Out of all the games found at a casino, baccarat is certainly the one that is considered the most prestigious and exclusive. There are several reasons for this, but mainly because baccarat has always been seen as a game with a grand reputation and rich European history that makes it worthy of special attention, and, in some cases, a roped off area on the casino floor. Players thus can’t be blamed for thinking that baccarat is a complex game to learn, and yet – if the truth be told – baccarat is probably the simplest game to learn in any casino setting.

The Objective
The objective of baccarat is to obtain a two or three hand of cards, with the total of these cards being nearer to the number nine than the banker’s hand of cards. All cards in baccarat maintain their own face value, except for the ace that is worth one and royal cards that are worth zero. Players bet which of the two sides – the banker (banco) or the player (punto) – reach closest to nine or whether the two sides tie. Other than placing their bets, players’ involvement in this game doesn’t go much more beyond this point and they are free to sit back and enjoy baccarat.

The History
Baccarat is believed to have originated from an ancient Etruscan ritual and revived by Felix Falguiere during the Middle Ages. The game was transformed into a wagering pastime using tarot cards. Baccarat is probably named for the Italian slang word meaning zero. By the 1500’s baccarat was wildly popular among the French and Italian nobility, until it made its way to the English courts, South America and finally to American shores. US casino owners realized that to increase baccarat’s popularity among local players, they would need to make it more accessible and so ‘mini-baccarat’ was invented, with easier rules and less pomp.
