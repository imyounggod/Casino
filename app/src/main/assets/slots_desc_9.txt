How to play
Whenever players click the yellow button with a couple of dark curved cursors, Bastet will perform a move to make all 5 reels and 4 rows spin. It's definitely a good idea to check the bet settings before you start playing. To get the most from the Bastet and Cats slot, you have to find the right bet. There's a list with seven betting options: €0.40, €0.80, €2, €4, €8, €20, and €40.

The rest of the options can be accessed from the main screen too. There is a speaker sign that regulates the sound and music, for example. You will find a rabbit icon that accelerates the animations. Players can rely on the Auto-play button that offers an infinite number of automated spins and various limits if they want to speed up the gameplay. If you use the three lines, you’ll access the paytable and game settings.

Symbols and payouts
Users should expect a list that includes nine standard symbols in the Bastet and Cats slot. The low-paying ones look like modified playing card signs with hieroglyphs. Three, four, or five 10s on a line will provide 2x, 10x, or 50x the line bet. Whenever you get three, four, or five Jacks or the same numbers of Queens on a payline, you will win 4x, 15x, or 75x your bet per line. You can win up to 75 times your line bet with the Kings too. Three, four, or five Aces on a payline will deliver 5, 20, or 100 times your line bet.

The four high-paying standard symbols start with the Pharaoh's Mask. When you land three, four, or five Masks on a payline, you will win 10, 25, or 250 times your line bet. Identical combinations of Cats will provide 20, 75, or 500 times your bet per line. There's also a Black Cat that delivers prizes worth 25, 150, or 1000 times your line bet. It would be best if you make combinations with Bastet. Three, four, or five Goddesses on a payline will provide prizes equal to 50, 250, or 2000 times your bet per line.
