How to Play
The Bamboo Bear slot gameplay is a bit different from the popular pay line mechanics. Instead, it offers you 243 ways to win and many opportunities for success. This is set across five reels and three rows, to move with the Spin button below the reel layout. Click on the Rabbit for fast-paced gameplay and on A for Autoplay.

If you land two, three, four, or five identical symbols on consecutive reels, you get a winning combination. The position of the matching symbols doesn't matter, as long as they started from the leftmost reel and are moving on adjacent columns.

When you land a win, it's multiplied by your bet. You can choose to play with the lowest stake, which is €0.25. There are seven other bet levels, with the highest being €50.

Symbols and Payouts
The slot has different symbols on its five reels, some unlocking bonuses, and others giving payouts.

10 and 9 are part of the minor symbols, offering 3x your stake for five of a kind. While J offers 4x the bet, Q will reward you with 5x the bet for five adjacent reels. Then, K gives a payout of 10x, and A pays 12x the bet.

The Pink Lotus will impress you with 16x the total bet for five of it on consecutive reels. You also get 30x the stake when you hit five Yin-Yang symbols.

The Floating Lantern rewards a whopping 40x the total stake when you have five of it on successive reels, and then the Coin pays 60x the stake.

The Panda is the Wild symbol, offering no separate payouts and appearing everywhere except reel 1. Then, the Scatter is the Palace and will give you an impressive reward of 50x your stake when you land five across the reels. These two symbols appear in the base game and Free Spins.
