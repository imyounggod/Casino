Introduction

OneTouch is an online casino software developer that is based out of the Isle of Man. The company was founded in 2015 and focuses on the mobile market primarily, putting out a series of table games and slot machines that can be played on your smartphone. The group uses the Provably Fair system for ensuring that their games are on the level, and they’ve done a good job of showing that everything is legitimate with their titles.

OneTouch has an interesting mixture of games, which I applaud. I'm bored with doing reviews of slots only software brands. Of their ten games at the time of this review, only two were slots. They also have the rarely seen Russian Poker (sometimes called Lunar Poker). All due credit for trying something different.

I do have to take OneTouch to task for a couple of things:

Some of their pays are extremely stingy. For example, the side bet in Russian Poker has a house edge of 18.34%. However, their sic bo game is the worst. The bet on a total of 4 or 17 pays only 18 to 1, for a house edge of 47.22%. Meanwhile, their slots, blackjack, roulette, and baccarat games are competitive. They need to be more consistent with the kind of value they offer their players.

They clearly ripped off my rules for Russian Poker for their help file. More on that in my section for that game.

OneTouch does hold a gaming license through the jurisdiction of Malta, and they’ve been working with different platform groups to distribute their games in regulated markets. The future for this group is bright, and it will be interesting to see where they go moving forward.
