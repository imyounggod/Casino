Gameplay
OneTouch launched their High Hand Hold’em poker game in 2019 and, a year later, it is showing just what a good investment it was.

It brings the high stakes game of High Hand Poker straight to your mobile or desktop device and is great for hours of fun as you try to outplay the dealer and hit that straight or flush on the river card.

As with any good poker game your strategy and knowledge of the rules and variations will be key to making winning decisions.

The game itself is smooth and fast with a bet range of R1, R5, R25, R100, R500 and R1,000.

The rules are your basic High Hand Hold’em poker rules.

What really makes High Hand Hold’em stand out is the optional side bet where you can bet on getting a winning hand of 3 of a kind or higher.

Decks
High Hand Hold’em is played with a single deck of 52 cards, no jokers or wilds. The deck is shuffled before every hand.


Graphics
Graphics are crisp and clean with every card easy to see. The side bet table can be a bit faint on mobile device but knowing your poker hands and that everything from 3 of a kind and higher is a progressively larger win helps.

Sound
The sound is very basic with card and chip noises and a cheesy backing track which can be quite annoying after a while (this reviewer chose to mute both and have my own music playing).
