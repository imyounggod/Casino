Theme, Graphics & Soundtrack

Anksunamun was a daughter of Queen Nefertiti and half-sister and wife to the legendary Tutankhamun. She’s achieved immortality through the Mummy movies as the mistress of Imhotep and the catalyst for all the mayhem.

This is a sophisticated slot in rich tones of gold and chocolate and seems plain visually until you start to spin up the superbly well-drawn picture symbols.

Anksunamun and Tutankhamun are depicted with laser-like eyes that make them seem slightly menacing, while Anubis and Horus are faithfully depicted. Watching them all is Bastet, the Egyptian cat goddess who sits guard by the reels.

The Egyptian-style soundtrack is sweeping and cinematic and moves this slot along nicely. As usual, the royals take up too much reel space, undoing the good work in the rest of this slickly designed game.
