Are you ready for an exciting journey that takes you all the way back to the Wild West?

With Cancan Saloon by Mascot Gaming software provider you will get a chance to either become a sheriff or join a group of dangerous outlaws without any repercussions!

This 5-reeled online title not only comes with 15 fixed paylines, but interesting graphics and a soundtrack that matches the surroundings perfectly as well!

On top of that, it also packs some special features – Random Wild Reels, Free Spins and Shooting Bonus Feature!

Theme And Symbols
Right off the bat, this online product sets an incredibly immersive experience thanks to its graphics, but more importantly, the soundtrack that can be heard blasting in the background.

Across the reels you will get to see symbols that are needed in everyday life of both, outlaws and sheriffs – revolvers, horseshoes and wanted posters, all acting as the symbols that award higher payouts.

For the lower paying symbols the provider decided to go with a more traditional choice – card symbols A-9 that still blend in with their surroundings perfectly.

Betting Options And Other Functions
Things don’t stop looking bright for this online game as we get to the betting options either.

To start things off we have the lowest bet that amounts to only 0.15 credits which will come in as pleasant news to newer and casual players.

Then again, if you consider yourself a seasoned veteran, you will have options that can get as high as 30 credits, which might not be that high, but it is still a decent option to have.
