Carnaval Do Rio RTP & Volatility
The RTP of 95.28% is below average for an online slot, but the game is so much fun that we’re almost prepared to overlook that fact. What can’t be denied is the game’s medium-to-high volatility, which makes it a particularly risky option to play with real cash, particularly over the short term.

How To Play Carnaval Do Rio
For a three-reel slots game, Carnaval Do Rio has quite a lot going on. But follow our step-by-step guide and you’ll be enjoying the party atmosphere in next to no time!

1. Decide how much you’re prepared to pay for each spin of the reels. Use the big, chunky ‘+’ and ‘-‘ buttons just below the reels to make your selection.

2. Before plunging headlong into the game, it’s worth doing a quick bit of research. Check out the game’s paytable by tapping on the yellow ‘I’ button to the far bottom left of your screen. The paytable is dynamic, so it’ll show you wins based on your actual stake.

3. Now that you know what the game might have in store, it’s time to get those reels spinning. Tap on the Spin button, which is located at the far bottom right of your screen.

4. Sit back and watch the on-screen action unfold with the help of Autoplay. This is the button with an ‘A’ on it, just to the left of Spin. Tap here and you’ll be given plenty of options for selecting your preferred number of spins, win and loss amounts and whether to stop Autoplay if you hit the game’s feature. You can still override Autoplay yourself by tapping on the button again.

5. If you’d rather play in silence or to the accompaniment of your own playlist, you can mute game sounds from the speaker icon at the base of the screen.
