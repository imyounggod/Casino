243 Crystal Fruits Reversed is a fruit/vegetable themed slot game developed by Tom Horn Gaming. Different from the previous version, this one provides a different spin on the original recipe. The previous symbols exploded once, but with this, the symbols stay put into maximising your wins. The fruits have a wild symbol which is continuously refreshed with new looks.

At the beginning of the game, there are 5X3 reels, but only 5 lines remain active. There are up to 243 winning ways with a potential of up to 990.5x the stake when the respin feature is activated. 243 Crystal Fruits Reversed also has wilds and sticky wilds which players should look out for. There is high volatility and an RTP of 96%, which is average for a slot machine.

Paytable and Symbols

While fruits are the main symbol for the original slot, Tom Horn Gaming has given the new version an alternate twist and look. There are cherries, watermelons, grapes, and other fruity symbols which have a crystalline look. These symbols are arranged on a 5Ã—3 grid. Cherries and Lemons are the lowest paying symbols (0.5x your stake when three appear on a payline) while red 7s are the highest paying up to 20x when five appear on a Payline.

An iconic feature is the reverse respin which is similar to the one in the previous versions of the slot. When creating a winning combo, the original version had them explode, but with this version, they become sticky, and the Respin can continue as long as there is a winning combination.
