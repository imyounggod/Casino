It’s for good reason that Baccarat is such a popular casino game around the world. Featured in films and made famous by James Bond himself, players flock to land-based casinos to experience this game first hand.

Thankfully, there’s no need to leave your comfortable couch if you don’t want to as you can play from home with ease. Simply fire up your laptop and get ready to place bets and watch as the cards unfold before you. If Lady Luck is on your side, you could be sitting pretty with an impressive win while enjoying NetEnt’s Baccarat Pro table game.

Theme, Sounds and Symbols
When entering that table game, step up to the table and grab a chair of your choosing because the game is always hot and ready with NetEnt. Baccarat Pro is a popular series designed by NetEnt, and it offers you something more than just the regular way to play.

The table before you are covered in green felt and your betting stations are simple to see. Even if you’ve never played before, Baccarat Pro makes it easy to get started.

You’ll find your chips at the bottom of the screen, and you can choose between a minimum of €1 and a maximum of €100 per bet. Watch as your bets land on the table with the distinct ‘clinking’ of chips, and then the game can begin!

Game Mechanics
As with every other form of Baccarat, the game aims to place your bet on who will receive cards that most closely total the number 9. You can bet on yourself as the player, the banker or on a tie between the two.

Once you’ve placed your bet, the cards will be dealt, and the winner will be rewarded. You can choose to reset your winnings or place a brand-new bet to get started once more.
