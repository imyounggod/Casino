Is there a more perfect slot machine for when October comes around? Book of Spells, while ideally played during the month of Halloween, can be enjoyed throughout the year, though waiting for a full moon grants it extra power.

The witches of the local coven have finally unearthed the book of spells, the ultimate guide to becoming a powerful wiccan, and the magic inside can be turned to good or used for bad. Our fate and that of those we know depends on how the witches choose to explore their newfound abilities.

Even though you’ll be brewing a lot of potions, watching as they learn with yourself now the apprentice, you need to keep in mind what your quest is all about: stop anything bad from happening. Win the x5,000 jackpot. Do either of those or both and the Book of Spells slot machine will be safe once more.

Opening the Book
Unlike normal books that simply open and close when you want them to, this particular tome has to be coaxed into willingly offering up its wonders, and would you believe that money is the only thing it responds to. I know, we were shocked too.

The Book of Spells will allow you to alter the 9 paylines as you see fit, but they won’t let you bet below 0.05 or over 2 coins, which means you’ll always have to play with either a small stake of 0.45 or a large one of 18. Although the book may frown upon caution, you can play with whatever amount you feel is best for you - you can even play the free slot version if you’d prefer. You won’t get any real wins and so no money will be gifted to you, but the choice is yours.

Selecting the Max Bet button won’t just change the wager amount, it’ll also begin the spins for you. In a similar fashion that’s what the Autoplay does, only it doesn’t do anything to your cashflow, only helping to make playing more manageable; fingers begin aching when they’re always in use. The wickedness of slot machines come to haunt us.
