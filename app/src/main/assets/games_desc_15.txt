An ancient battle plays out across the Dragon & Tiger slot machine from Ganapati. Clusters of five or more matching symbols vanish from the 7x7 grid, allowing new ones to drop down to fill the void. The game's Trigger Areas move around the reels in each spin, as the two adversaries circle each other. Wilds can expand to fill these areas, completing big clusters.

It doesn't stop there! When you play the Dragon & Tiger slot online, a fortune wheel unlocks free games, Mini, Minor, or the Grand jackpot prize, worth 1,000x your stake. What's not to love?

Enter the Dragon & Tiger
Japanese developer Ganapati use colorful but abstract symbols of mythical beasts on the grid. They sit against a plain grey backdrop, but the reels look like an unrolled scroll, topped off with red and gold decorations. Itâ€™s quite effective, and if you have the Dragon & Tiger slot machine in landscape mode, you get dramatic images of the two main beasts.

These animals fight for gems and mythical pearls that will enhance their powers. They appear on the grid as moving Trigger Areas, surrounded by animated flames. The blue dragon and orange tiger Trigger Areas can vary in size from between 2x2 to 3x7, with each revealing special powers when wild symbols land within.

A traditional Oriental soundtrack accompanies this Asian styled online slot machine, although mechanical sound effects can sometimes drown out the tune. Fortunately, there is a setting to adjust the volume of one or the other to suit your preference.

Collect the Clusters of Symbols
The Dragon & Tiger online slot uses the cluster pays system. You win by landing groups of five or more matching symbols, linked horizontally, vertically, or in blocks. This paylines table shows you how much clusters are worth at stakes of 1.00 per spin at the minimum of five symbols and maximum of 40-49.
